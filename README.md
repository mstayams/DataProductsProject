# DevelopingDataProducts Project 

Course Project for coursera Developing Data Products
### This is the course project for Coursera Developing Data Products.   Under this we will study the mtcars dataset shipped with R.  

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973 and 74 models).  We study the dependency of mileage on different features like number of cylinders, transmission type, weight of the car, horse power etc.  We will use the summary command to display the data ranges for different features of the dataset.

We build multi-variate linear model for mpg (miles per gallon) and the rest of features (predictors) of the mtcars.   We build this application using the shiny package of R.   The GUI provides the  panel for entering the input values for different predictors.   When the Submit button is clicked,   the model predicts the mileage for the input values.
